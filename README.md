**Optimize Python performance by creating Python pip modules in Rust with PyO3**

## What is this book about?
Python has made software development easier, but it falls short in several areas including memory management that lead to poor performance and security. Rust, on the other hand, provides memory safety without using a garbage collector, which means that with its low memory footprint, you can build high-performant and secure apps relatively easily. However, rewriting everything in Rust can be expensive and risky as there might not be package support in Rust for the problem being solved. This is where Python bindings and pip come in.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore the quirks of the Rust programming language that a Python developer needs to understand to code in Rust 
* Understand the trade-offs for multiprocessing and thread safety to write concurrent code
* Build and manage a software project with cargo and crates
* Fuse Rust code with Python so that Python can import and run Rust code
* Deploy a Python Flask application in Docker that utilizes a private Rust pip module
* Inspect and create your own Python objects in Rust

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
use std::error::Error;
use std::fs::File;
use csv;
use super::structs::FootPrint;
let code = "5 + 6";
let result = py.eval(code, None, Some(&locals)).unwrap();
let number = result.extract::<i32>().unwrap();
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for Python developers who want to speed up their Python code with Rust and implement Rust in a Python system without altering the entire system.
